# Webpack-react-app

I have created this repository because many I configure my react applications with webpack and it is very problematic to have to always be doing the process from scratch, so I decided to create this template from scratch to take it as a reference every time I want an application from react in once to be using create-react-app or configure it again from scratch and if it serves more great people.
